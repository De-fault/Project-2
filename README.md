# Project-2
For this project we as a group were suppose to do multiple task which eventuly led to a pen test using the code we're given half way through the project and thne we also added some of our own code along side it to improve the program. 
Everythone in the group had their own task but everyone had a go/look at what the others were doing to see if they could help out or had some input to improve the overall project.
We used GitHub to keep track of put notes and also we planed on saving the final code of the rogram once it was ready and test. 
The main task sof the induals in the groups are listed below:
Vishvas Nayi - GitHub and Trello 
Oliver King - Trello and Raspberry Pi router
Timmy Godleman - Project Leader
George Vince - Coding
Chris Hubbard - Coding
Jack Mcnabb - Tea Boy
